	\item A \textbf{commune} is a community where members only pay the annual customary head tax to their ruler, fees for breaking the law with no other financial burdens imposed.
	\item Essentially. It was the regular townspeople forming the commune, for the purpose of foregoing other financial fees throughout the year. The sum paid to form the commune went to the ruling/upper class of nobles and clergy.
	\item Establishing the commune involved the nobles to profess oaths, stating they would maintain their end of the agreement. The beginning of the revolt stems from the Bishop forcing the King and all parties involved in the creation of the commune, to break their oaths.
	\item After the bishop revoked the commune, the townspeople left their jobs and positions. They did not expect to have much wealth left after the ruling class was to tax them.

\section*{Reading 96 : Problems among the Clergy at Rouen Cathedral : 1248}

\subsection*{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Bishops regularly visited churches, cathedrals and monasteries to ensure proper religious conduct was followed.
	\item This reading describes a bishop's visit to a Cathedral in Rouen
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Notes}

\subsection*{Question}

\textit{What impression does this inquiry give us of the activities of the cathedral clergy within the town of Rouen?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The cathedral clergy in Rouen did not practice church conduct with proper rigour
	\item The clergy also engaged with the local townspeople often, mostly when performing activities forbidden by the church
	\item Certain cathedral members talked to women during choir, left choir without reason, said Psalms too fast etc.
	\item Many of the Masters and Sirs were incontinent , thieves, murderers, drunkedness, dicing and trading. 
\end{itemize}

\textit{What were considered the right relations between the clergy and townspeople?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It appears that the interactions between the clergy and townspeople should be limited to the basics (food, water etc.) and items realted to the church. This can be seen because of the bishop's anger towards clergy trading, engaging with merchants and being drunkards.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Reading 97 : The Beguines of Ghent, 1328}

\subsection*{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Beguine is a name for women devoting themselves to Gods but who were not nuns. Unlike Nuns, they were able to go about normal lives.
	\item Beguines lived in Beguinages
	\item This reading is from an inquiry into the Beguinage in Ghent.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Notes}

\subsection*{Question}

\textit{Is there any evidence of why so many urban women were drawn to the Beguine movement?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There were many women who did not have husbands and could not enter a monastery because of capacity. 
	\item Women were drawn to beguinages because they could remain chase but have food, shelter and community
	\item Were there more women at this time because of a war and the men were gone?
\end{itemize}

\textit{To what extent did Beguines participate in town life?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The principal mistress of the Beguinage ensured beguines did not stay in town for a night without permission and could not leave for an hour.
	\item They are not intended to meet suspect people when they do go into town
	\item The passage paints a lack of involvement in town life
\end{itemize}

\textit{Is there any evidence of how the townspeople might have viewed these religious women who lived in the world, rather than a convent?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item TODO
\end{itemize}

\section*{Reading 98 - The Good Canon of Cologne}

\subsection*{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Describes the virtue of a Canon in order to guide and train novices becoming monks
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Question}
\textit{What types of social, religious and charitable interactions did the canon have with the townspeople of Cologne?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item He consistently gave away food, coin and others to the impoverished
	\item He brought the people to feasts as guests
	\item TODO
\end{itemize}

\textit{What does the passage tell us about attitudes towards the poor?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It tells us that most were not really cared for by the Church, making what the Canon did exceptional.
	\item The meeting with Abbess confirms that certain clergy were opulent and not pious like the canon
\end{itemize}

\textit{Why does the canon criticize the abbess and how does his concern compare to the complaints of the reforming bishop of Rouen in doc. 96?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item He criticizes her because she and her group are dressed nicely whereas he is surrounded by the poor. The money she used on clothing and luxury, could have been given to the poor
	\item The complaints are similar but also different. The Bishop of Rouen complained about the rigour of church practice and how certain members traded, were incontinent, and drunkards. However, he never commented on their morality, like the Canon does to the Abbess. The canon's complaints are moral complaints and align themself with the teachings of the Church. The Bishop's complaints were about Church policy and conduct, but not the specific teachings in the Bible.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Reading 99 : A Popular Franciscan Preacher in Paris : 1429}

\subsection*{Question}

\textit{What does this passage tell us about sermonizing and its impact in medieval towns?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It tells us that it was able to have a large impact when the preacher was charismatic and consistently preached. Brother Richard was very frequent with his preaching and as a result, was able to talk to a large audience.
\end{itemize}
\textit{Why were people compelled to attend these long sermons?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item People may have felt compelled to attend because he travelled to Paris specifcally for the purpose of preaching. He may have been known and respected as well, making people more inclined to hear him talk.
	\item As well, the writer wrote this during the tumultuous years of the Hundred Year's War. Perhaps this caused people to want to be more pious in order to end the suffering the conflict caused?
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
